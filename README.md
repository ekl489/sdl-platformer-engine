# SDL Platformer Engine
> Created by Nicholas Ramsay

This project aims to develop a platformer engine using strong object-oriented approaches. The `main.cpp` file seeks to show the setup required in utilising my engine.

## Sprites

Currently the main bulk of the project lies in the development of sprites.
They can inherit IBounded, IGravitated and IMovable.
